            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>Mandalay was founded by King Mindon,the second-last king of the Konbaung Dynasty, in 1857. He built it to move the capital of the Empire from Amapura to a new location, with the intention of making it a religious center for Buddhism. It was the last royal capital of the Burmese kingdom until it was colonized by the British Empire in 1885. It went through series of destructions during the peak of World War II from both British and Japanese occupation, but the city persisted in surviving complete destruction. Today, Mandalay acts as the cultural capital of Myanmar, with rich historical, cultural, and religious values for the people of Myanmar. </p>

            <h2>Brief Geography</h2>
            <p>Mandalay is the second-largest city, located at the center of Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country that shares borders with India, Bangladesh, China, Laos, and Thailand. Mandalay is an interesting valley region with diverse geography. The city is surrounded by the Shan Highlands Mountains to the east of the city, while the Ayeyarwaddy River surrounds its western side. The Ayeyarwaddy River is the most significant river in the country and provides vital resources for both trade and agriculture. As the center of the country while being built along the most important river, Mandalay acts as an economic hub connecting to the rest of the country. </p>
